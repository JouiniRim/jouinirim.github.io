<p style="text-align: justify;">
I hold a PhD in Computer Science and am a member of the CRISTAL Laboratory – RAMSIS team at ENSI (National School of Computer Science, Tunisia).

My research primarily focuses on data science, a branch of artificial intelligence aimed at extracting insights from complex and diverse datasets. Earlier in my work, I focused on predictive modeling and machine learning, with the goal of uncovering meaningful hidden patterns in challenging data — often characterized by low-quality, heterogeneous, and temporally complex structures. I have explored various types of pattern structures, including itemsets, sequences, and graphs, with a particular interest in spatio-temporal data — such as time series related to health information collected via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).

More recently, my focus has shifted towards data-centric approaches in AI. This paradigm highlights the crucial role of data quality, collection strategies, and preprocessing in achieving relevant and reliable AI outcomes — beyond model design alone.
